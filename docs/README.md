# The Bela Blog: A blog for Bela
This is built on the Trophy theme with some major changes.

## Things to do
1. Get the images working from a directory in this repo. Currently I'm just using something random from unsplash.com.
2. Make a profiles directory, so the author can put their info at the bottom of a post.
3. Include some social shiz on the front page.
4. Get some better fonts going - the one this blog came with is a bit obnoxious.
5. Implement a little search function. Something like this: https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search
6. Write some stuff that will handle images in posts, as well as youtube videos, and make them look not-shit on both desktop and mobile.
